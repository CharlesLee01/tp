Pawbook is a desktop application for dog school managers to facilitate their bookkeeping of puppies and dogs in the school, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). Besides maintaining dog profiles for each unique dog, managers can view daily class schedules on Pawbook to better plan the day’s activities.
